        <h3>How does a Web Browser Work?</h3>
            <p>A web browser helps us find information anywhere on the internet. It is installed on the client computer
                and requests information from the web server such a type of working model is called a client-server
                model.
                <br>

                The browser receives information through HTTP protocol. In which transmission of data is defined. When
                the browser received data from the server, it is rendered in HTML to user-readable form and, information
                is displayed on the device screen.
